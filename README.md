### G@-1$fa3%?;

A feature has secretly made its way into the mod, but does not wish to be found out.
It is out there, but will not make it easy to obtain it.

## Experimental features

<details><summary><b>Blavingad contained use</b></summary>
This feature allows you to use items in your world from inside a container plushie, much like the Blavingad.

As it stands, when enabled, this feature allows you to throw potions and use totems much like in vanilla, but
from the blavingad.

However! This feature is highly unstable and it is unrecommended to use with other items until certified as
working properly! Hence, it is restrained to a definite item tag `blahaj:blavingad_usable`, and restrained
by the `blahaj.contained.enable_use` gamerule, which by default is `false`.

While certified to work fine with vanilla totems and both splash and lingering potions, it is not
guaranteed that adding other items to the tag will work. It is therefore recommended to make backups before
testing anything risky!

# Builtin Compatibilities

## [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyalexandra/trinkets)

Plushies can be worn in multiple Trinket slots! Each with their own rendering!

## [Traveler's Backpack](https://modrinth.com/mod/travelersbackpack)

Now with a custom additional backpack! (no special ability though)

## [Not Enough Animations](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-enough-animations)

Sleeping cuddle pose and item cuddling works despite the Not Enough Animations' "no sleeping item" setting.

This does not force the setting or temporarily changes it! The setting is only ignored for plushies

## [Immersive Melodies](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-melodies)

_Only available in 1.20.1 to this day_

Adds a brand-new instrument when Immersive Melodies is loaded.
